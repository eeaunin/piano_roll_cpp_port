Agent Guide for piano_roll_cpp_port (Scope: This directory)

- Purpose: Experimental Dear ImGui C++ piano roll inspired by `../dpg_piano_roll`.
- Do not edit any files outside this directory; treat `dpg_piano_roll` as a read-only reference.
- Focus on clean C++20 design: clear data structures, coordinate system, and interaction model.
- Prefer separation of concerns similar to the Python project (data, coordinates, rendering, interaction, commands).
- Keep `docs/PLAN.md` up to date with the implemented feature subset and any deviations from the original behaviour.
